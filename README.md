# Blackjack Game

I have created a Blackjack game using JavaScript and the below game instructions.

## Instructions

* Create a simple blackjack game with the following properties:

  * Deals the player a random number between 4 and 21 inclusive.
  
    * If the player has 21 they win!
   
  * Deals a random number between 2 and 11 inclusive to the dealer.
   
  * If the player hits, add a number between 2 and 11.
   
    * If the player goes over 21 the lose.
     
    * If the player has 21, stay for them.
     
    * Repeat until they choose to stay or they bust
     
  * Once player stays add a number between 2 and 11 to the dealer's hand.
     
    * If dealer number is less than 17 add another number
     
    * Repeat until the number is over over 17 but less than 21, or if the dealer goes over 21
     
    * If dealer goes over 21 they lose.
  
  * Once dealer stops, and neither player bust, compare each number to 21. Whoever is closer wins!
